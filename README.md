# APR
Assignments for Computer Aided Analysis and Design (APR) at FER.

The course consists of the following topics: precision and rounding errors in floating point number operations, matrix operations and LUP decomposition, linear equation systems, 
non-linear function optimization, evolutionary algorithms and analysis of transient phenomena.

Assignments written in Java.

# Assignment 1 (APRLab1)
Matrix class implemented with all necessary variables, operators, constructors and other methods.
Also implemented LU/LUP decomposition which is also used for solving linear equations and finding inverse matrices.

# Assignment 2 (APRLab2)
Some basic numerical optimization algorithms are implemented. Algorithms include:

1.) Golden section algorithm

2.) Unimodal interval search

3.) Hooke-Jeeves algorithm

4.) Nelder-Meade algorithm

5.) Coordinate search
